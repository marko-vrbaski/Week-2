# Week 2 Memos-to-Self

 New Terms
- **DEBS codes**: Numbering system for categorizing grave monuments (chest tombs, table tombs, tops).
- **KoBoToolbox**: Data entry tool for recording monument + inscription info.
- **Site code**: Short 4-letter code to represent the cemetery (I used `sirc` for Saint Isidore Roman Catholic Cemetery).
- **Memorial number**: Stone identifier (sirc-01, sirc-02, etc.).

 Commands / Processes
- Created datasets in Excel/CSV to track gravestone attributes.
- Saved aerial photo of cemetery and annotated with IDs (sirc-01 to sirc-05).
- Downloaded gravestone images from FindAGrave (right-click save).
- Entered stone data into KoBoToolbox (monuments + inscription info).

 Errors / Issues
- DEBS typology doesn’t match cross-topped pillars → coded closest match and added notes.
- Some inscriptions unreadable in photos (blurred, weathered).
- Duplicate images of the AHEARN stone (sirc-02, sirc-03, sirc-04) — had to decide how to record.

 Websites Used
- [FindAGrave](https://findagrave.com)
- [KoBoToolbox form](https://ee.kobotoolbox.org/x/vFoK4DMY)

 Notes to Future Self
- Always keep site code and memorial number consistent between datasets.
- Record uncertainties and mismatches — they matter for the reflection.
- Don’t stress about missing data (measurements, orientations) — just note limitations.
