# Week 2 Reflective Journal

> “No archaeological project ever goes off perfectly without a hitch. Adapting and working through the consequences is part of the point.”  

The process of recording data requires equal effort to establish boundaries as it does to gather information according to this statement.
The process of using FindAGrave photos instead of visiting gravesites required me to make continuous adjustments because I encountered duplicate images and unclear inscriptions and monuments that did not match the DEBS codes properly. 
The actual process of digital archaeology required me to perform this work which did not constitute failure.

- Ethical Issues
The process of digital work requires researchers to consider multiple ethical factors. 
The gravestones serve as physical markers for deceased individuals and their related family members. 
The public availability of these photos does not diminish their sacred and emotional value as monuments. 
The process of incorrect inscription classification or transcription leads to false representations of deceased individuals' memories. 
The moral duty of archaeologists to treat data with respect becomes evident to me through this experience.

- Physical / Practical Challenges
The absence of physical presence eliminated my ability to determine orientation and scale and feel the material texture of the objects. 
The missing elements restricted my ability to express certain ideas. 
The entire visual content of the images depended on the perspective of the person who took the photographs. 
Digital archaeology requires trust in unseen collaborators who first uploaded the images to the system.

- My Context
The Canadian Roman Catholic cemetery features crosses and religious symbols which make up most of its visual elements. 
The design elements serve more than aesthetic purposes because they hold essential meaning for the local community. The numerical classification ***7 (“low monument on top”) successfully describes the monument's form but fails to convey its cultural importance. The digital classification system fails to capture the complete meaning of these symbols which creates a significant problem for me.

- Reflection
My notes in `wk2-memos.md` show that what I initially considered errors turned out to be important learning experiences. The DEBS system fails to classify cross-topped pillars because this indicates a tool limitation rather than my own abilities. The practice of digital archaeology through virtual methods combines data recording with active evaluation of the information being collected. The process reveals to me which systems fail to match actual conditions and this discovery provides essential knowledge.
